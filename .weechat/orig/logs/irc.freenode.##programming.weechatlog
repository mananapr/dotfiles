2016-08-27 14:20:57	ackpacket	RustyShackleford, Listen.  Each person is tracked individually, at least roughly.  Each table's count is tracked, quite easily.  Casinos are good with stats.
2016-08-27 14:21:11	ackpacket	If you do something that doesn't make sense, you'll be noticed.
2016-08-27 14:21:38	ackpacket	Sure, they won't connect you to lowbetting a bad count.  Instead, you'll just show yourself to be that guy that always shows up at a table when the count is good.
2016-08-27 14:21:54	ackpacket	Then everyone at that table is burned

2016-08-27 14:29:43	ackpacket	RustyShackleford, It's said that tier 1 players play the cards in front of them, tier 2 players play the cards in front of the other player, and tier 3 play the cards the other player *thinks* are in front of their opponent

2016-08-27 14:33:41	RustyShackleford	is there a book you read?
2016-08-27 14:33:47	ackpacket	He continues to do it because it's profitable.  It's profitable because you're leaving value on the table.

2016-09-12 17:33:56	starship_trooper	ioanm: what problem?
2016-09-12 17:34:00	ioanm	what if you want to calculate the age of a person that died in the 16th century?
2016-09-12 17:34:02	fmbb	starship_trooper, So a technique you should learn is testing. Feed in a list of inputs to the program and have it automatically check the outputs against a pre-constructed list you made yourself.
